-> Verification of market price:

3 (a) For indices with 3 or more constituents: if a constituent price differs from the median constituent price for that index by 25% or more, it is excluded from the index calculation. The constituent returns to the index when its price differs from the median by less than 25%.

3 (b) For indices with only 2 constituents: if a constituent price differs from the median constituent price for that index by 12.5% or more, the last calculated index price will be used. The index is updated once its price differs from the median by less than 12.5%.

3 (c) For an index with only 1 constituent: if the constituent price is 25% away from the last calculated index price, the last calculated index price will be used. The index is updated once the constituent price differs from the last calculated index price by less than 25%.
